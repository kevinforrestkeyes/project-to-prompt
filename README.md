# project-to-prompt

this project includes two scripts: the **project file generator** and the **project structure recreation**. i made this in the year 3023 to help facillitate gpt-driven development. i found that when i was having an extended back-and-forth with gpt about a project it would start to get confused about the different versions of files we would be working with. this is to allow me to start fresh in a new instance once it starts to hallucinate and be able to quickly give it full context of the current version of my project. and as an added bonus, the recreate_project_structure can be used when gpt eviscerates your code, just ask it to output any suggested changes using the same format as your input file, copy it to a text file and run it through the recreate_project_structure and blammo, your project is now perfect. i'm this ü§è close to becoming obsolete. 

this was created with a node.js project in mind so if you want to use it for a different language you will probably need to make adjustments. i take no responsibility for the quality of the scripts, i didn't write them. i also didn't write most of this readme so i hope the instructions are correct.

## project file generator

the **project file generator** script generates a text file that contains the contents of each file within a specified root directory. it creates a comment line indicating the path of each file.

### usage

1. ensure that python is installed on your system.
2. download the `project_to_prompt.py` script.
3. open a command prompt or terminal.
4. navigate to the directory where you saved the `project_to_prompt.py` script.
5. run the script by executing the command `python project_to_prompt.py`.
6. follow the prompts to enter the root directory and specify the output file name.
7. the script will generate the output file with the contents of the files in the specified root directory.

## project structure recreation

the **project structure recreation** script recreates the project structure based on the contents of a text file generated by the **project file generator** script.

### usage

1. ensure that python is installed on your system.
2. download the `recreate_project_structure.py` script.
3. open a command prompt or terminal.
4. navigate to the directory where you saved the `recreate_project_structure.py` script.
5. run the script by executing the command `python recreate_project_structure.py`.
6. enter the path to the text file generated by the **project file generator** script when prompted.
7. the script will recreate the project structure within a folder that matches the name of the input text file, including files with their corresponding contents.

## credits

this project was created by chatgpt and i helped a little bit. the scripts utilize python and the `shutil` module for file management tasks.
